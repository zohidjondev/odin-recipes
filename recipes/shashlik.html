  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Shashlik, a popular grilled dish in Uzbek cuisine, consists of marinated meat skewered and cooked over an open flame. Traditionally made with lamb, but also with beef or chicken, the meat is marinated with onions, vinegar, and a blend of spices such as coriander, cumin, and black pepper. This process tenderizes the meat and infuses it with a rich flavor. Shashlik is typically enjoyed with fresh salads, bread, and a tangy dipping sauce.</p>
  <p>Shashlik is more than just a dish; it's a social event. Cooking and eating shashlik is a communal activity often enjoyed during gatherings and celebrations. The smoky aroma of grilling meat, the convivial atmosphere, and the delicious taste of perfectly cooked shashlik make it a cherished part of Uzbek culinary tradition.</p>
