      <p class="paragraph">Samsa is a beloved Uzbek pastry filled with a savory mixture of meat, onions, and spices. These flaky, golden pastries are typically baked in a tandoor oven, which gives them a unique texture and flavor. The filling usually consists of minced lamb or beef, finely chopped onions, and a blend of spices such as cumin and black pepper. Samsa is often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer and is perfect for sharing.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Samsa holds a special place in Uzbek cuisine, not only for its delicious taste but also for its cultural significance. It is commonly prepared for family gatherings, festivals, and celebrations. The process of making samsa is a labor of love, with the dough being carefully prepared and the fillings perfectly seasoned, making it a true representation of Uzbek hospitality and culinary expertise.</p>
